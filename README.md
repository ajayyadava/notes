These are my technical notes from everything :)

I watch lot of tech talk videos, read lot of books, learn new stuff from blogs/twitter/stackoverflow/articles etc. However, I have a very bad memory and I forget things very quickly if I don't revise. This is my one place source to search for the notes.

Exchanging notes -

If you benefit from any of these notes then I am very happy I could be of help! If you have something new that I can learn then send me a link/note through pull request and I will accept it gratefully if it fits.
