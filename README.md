These are my technical notes from everything :)

I watch lot of tech talk videos, read lot of books, learn new stuff from blogs/twitter/stackoverflow/articles etc. However, I have a very bad memory and I forget things very quickly if I don't revise. This is my one place source to search for the notes.

Exchanging notes -

If you benefit from any of these notes then I am very happy I could be of help! If you have something new that I can learn then send me a link/note through pull request and I will accept it gratefully if it fits.

This is inspired from [PyDanny's notes](https://github.com/pydanny/pydanny-event-notes/ "PyDanny Event Notes"). I can't attend as many conferences as he does but I try to watch the uploaded talk videos. End goal is however same - a place to organize knowledge from those great speakers/authors in a concise, easy to revisit format.
